fizz-buzz
=========

My solution to the 'fizz-buzz' coding interview challenge, implemented in only 120 characters, so it can easily fit in a text message or tweet!

Was reminded of this interview favorite lately, and decided to tinker with it a bit on my iPad during lunch recently.

###### For more info on this fun little challenge—that despite how easy it is, it seems many developers and programmers don't know how to do(?)—it goes something like this:

> *"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print 'Fizz' instead of the number and for the multiples of five print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 'FizzBuzz'."*
